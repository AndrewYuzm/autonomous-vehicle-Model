# autonomous-vehicle-Model
Note: This is not an open source project.

Responsibilities included high-speed traditional image capture and feature recognition using Infineon AURIX™ tri-core chip, and vehicle control algorithms. Also designed a Windows remote image visualization parameter Host system.

As the team leader, mainly responsible for the design of image algorithm code, high-speed McKnum wheel mini-car control, the hardware connection of camera between CH32 and Infineon® TC364 chip, the high-speed analysis and automatic driving of real-time images based on C language. 

The algorithm mainly include: dynamic PID control, “Otsu” image binarization, Edge and direction detection, Feature recognition, Serial dual MCU communication, upper computer software…
